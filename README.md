# learning_python

Join me on my journey of learning python with the goal of data analytics!  

On this journey, I will deep-dive into libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Then, I will test my abilities with assignments.

Based off "Zero to Pandas" Course. 



_updates:_ 
- finished visualization (using matplotlib & seaborn)
- now on to exploritory data analysis (an EDA project will then follow)
